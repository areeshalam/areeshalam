## 👨‍💻 About Me

I engineer distributed systems optimized for **reliability**, **performance**, and **long-term scalability**. My systems self-regulate under stress—deployments, caching, and monitoring pipelines all work together to maintain uptime and precision.

**Core Expertise:**

* **System Architecture** — scalable microservices and infrastructure.
* **Backend Engineering** — resilient APIs and pipelines (Node.js/TypeScript).
* **DevOps & Cloud** — CI/CD, IaC (Terraform), orchestration (AWS/K8s).
* **Performance Optimization** — tuning for throughput, latency, caching.
* **Security & Observability** — integrated security and real-time insight.

**Domains Served:**

* **Digital Media Networks**
* **E-Commerce Platforms**
* **Service-Driven Ecosystems**

**Select Projects:**

* **BEGENONE** – High-volume media social network.
* **WeReform** – Modular SaaS + infra automation.
* **RotFalken** – E-commerce operational transformation.
* **Global Vaddo** – Nonprofit platform modernization.

*Principle: Eliminate fragility, automate recovery, and let the system prove resilience through data—not assumptions.*

### 🧩 Note on Projects, Languages & Tools

> A significant portion of my engineering work resides in **private repositories** due to **client/project confidentiality**, **system sensitivity**, and **ongoing R&D**.  
>  
> What’s public here provides a glimpse into my broader engineering scope — focused on full-stack, DevOps, and systems design.  
>
> My **core production stack** revolves around:
>
> - **JavaScript / TypeScript**
> - **React · React Native · Node.js**
> - **Cloud Infrastructure** (AWS · Docker · Kubernetes · Terraform)
>
> I also maintain **working proficiency** in lower-level and enterprise ecosystems to strengthen my systems understanding:
>
> - **Java & Spring Boot** — for backend architecture and microservices patterns.  
> - **C & C++** — for systems-level insights and performance-critical modules.  
> - **C# & .NET Core** — for service-driven backend and desktop integrations.  
> - **Rust** — for exploring memory safety, concurrency, and performance.  
>
> While not yet advanced in these languages, I use them to deepen my understanding of **runtime behavior**, **memory models**, and **system optimization**.  
> Over time, I aim to bridge these ecosystems with my full-stack and cloud expertise.

## 🧭 How I Work

### ⚙️ Principles & Development Approach

- **Problem-First Mindset**  
  Every project starts with *why*. I define the problem, business value, and tradeoffs before a single line of code is written.

- **SDLC Grounded in Reality**  
  While I follow standard phases — *Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance* — I adapt them per project scope.  
  No ceremony for the sake of process. Just enough structure to deliver with clarity.

- **Build for Change, Not Perfection**  
  Code is expected to evolve. I prioritize readability, testability, and modularity over over-engineering.

- **Feedback-Centric Delivery**  
  Iteration is baked in. I ship early, demo often, and course-correct with real user insights.

- **Visibility as a Feature**  
  Logs, metrics, traces, and alerts are part of the product. I build with observability from day one.

- **Performance and Cost Consciousness**  
  Scale thoughtfully. I assess cost implications early — infra, latency, dev hours — and design accordingly.

- **Security Isn’t an Afterthought**  
  Threat modeling, secrets hygiene, and secure defaults are integrated across the lifecycle.

- **Tools Support Process, Not Vice Versa**  
  I don’t force tools into workflows. Git, CI/CD, task tracking, and review processes are shaped to accelerate delivery — not slow it down.
